# Guardrails - Critical Rules

Rules in this file represent mistakes that were made and must never be repeated. These are non-negotiable requirements that override convenience or efficiency considerations.

## 1. Temporal Resolution Must Be User-Selected

**Rule**: When ISIMIP data is available at multiple temporal resolutions (daily, monthly, annual), **ALWAYS ask the user which resolution they want before downloading**.

**Why this matters**:
- Monthly data is 12x larger than annual data
- Daily data is 365x larger than annual data
- A 10 MB annual file becomes 120 MB monthly or 3.6 GB daily
- Downloading the wrong resolution wastes significant time and storage

**Required workflow**:
1. Search ISIMIP and identify ALL available temporal resolutions
2. Present a summary table showing:
   - Resolution options (daily, monthly, annual)
   - Approximate file sizes for each
   - Number of datasets available at each resolution
3. Use `AskUserQuestion` to have the user explicitly choose
4. Only proceed with download after user selection

**Handling higher-frequency data (monthly/daily)**:
- See Rule §2 below for aggregation requirements
- Current processing scripts are designed for annual data aggregated to decadal metrics
- If monthly/daily data is selected, must ask user how to aggregate before processing

## 2. Sub-Annual Data Aggregation Requires User Choice

**Rule**: When processing monthly or daily data, **ALWAYS ask the user** how to aggregate before processing. Never auto-aggregate without explicit user approval.

**Why this matters**:
- Different variables require different aggregation methods based on their physical meaning
- **Density metrics** (g/m², kg/m², individuals/km²) → typically **mean**
- **Count/flux metrics** (events, kg/year, mm/day) → typically **sum**
- **Extreme metrics** (max temperature, min precipitation) → typically **max** or **min**
- **Categorical metrics** (dominant type, mode) → typically **mode**
- Wrong aggregation produces physically meaningless results

**Required workflow**:
1. Identify that data is sub-annual (monthly or daily)
2. **Tell user the variable units** (critical context for choosing aggregation)
3. Present aggregation options: mean, median, sum, min, max, mode
4. Use `AskUserQuestion` to get explicit user choice
5. Only proceed with processing after user selection
6. Document the aggregation method used in output metadata attributes

**Example aggregation guidance**:
| Variable | Units | Recommended Aggregation |
|----------|-------|------------------------|
| Biomass density | g C m⁻² | mean |
| Precipitation | mm/month | sum (for annual total) |
| Temperature | °C | mean (for annual avg), max/min (for extremes) |
| Fire events | count | sum |
| Species richness | count | mean or max |

## 3. Scenario Discovery Must Be Dynamic

**Rule**: Visualization and processing scripts must **discover scenarios from the filesystem**, not hardcoded lists. Never assume a fixed set of scenarios exists.

**Why this matters**:
- ISIMIP data includes varying scenarios: SSP (126, 245, 370, 585) and RCP (26, 45, 60, 85)
- Not all scenarios are always available for every variable/model combination
- Hardcoded lists silently exclude data that exists but isn't in the list
- Users may have custom scenario subsets

**Required behavior**:
- Scripts should glob for `{variable}_*_processed.nc` pattern
- Extract scenario names from filenames dynamically
- Load ALL matching files, not just predefined scenarios
- Use fallback labels/colors for unknown scenarios (e.g., "ssp245" → "SSP2-4.5")

## Incident Log

### 2026-01-16: Fish TCB Downloaded Without Resolution Choice

**What happened**: When searching for fish catch abundance data, I found both monthly (~135-158 MB/file) and annual (~8-12 MB/file) data available. I proceeded to download 28 monthly files (3.62 GB total) without asking the user which resolution they preferred.

**Impact**: Downloaded 12x more data than potentially needed if annual resolution was sufficient.

**Available options that should have been presented**:
| Resolution | Files | Size per file | Total |
|------------|-------|---------------|-------|
| Monthly | 24 files | 135-158 MB | ~3.5 GB |
| Annual | 4 files (ZooMSS only) | 8-12 MB | ~40 MB |

**Correct action**: Should have used `AskUserQuestion` to present both options and let user decide based on their analysis needs.

### 2026-01-20: Fish b30cm Processed Without Aggregation Choice

**What happened**: When processing b30cm (large fish biomass) monthly data, I automatically aggregated monthly values to annual using `groupby("time.year").mean()` without asking the user which aggregation method they preferred.

**Impact**: Processing proceeded with a reasonable method (mean for density data), but user was not consulted. In other cases (e.g., count data, extremes), this could have produced wrong results.

**What I did**:
- Monthly data → Annual: arithmetic mean of 12 months
- Annual → Decade: median across years in adaptive window
- Models → Ensemble: median across model outputs

**Correct action**: Should have:
1. Noted the units (g C m⁻²) are a density metric
2. Presented aggregation options: mean, median, sum, min, max
3. Used `AskUserQuestion` to get explicit user choice
4. In this case, user confirmed mean was correct for density units

**Outcome**: User approved mean aggregation post-hoc, but workflow was incorrect.

### 2026-01-20: Scenario rcp45 Excluded from Visualization

**What happened**: After processing b30cm data with all 4 RCP scenarios (rcp26, rcp45, rcp60, rcp85), the visualization script `generate_maps.py` only generated maps for 3 scenarios (rcp26, rcp60, rcp85), silently excluding rcp45.

**Root cause**: The script had hardcoded scenario lists:
```python
RCP_SCENARIO_LABELS = {
    "rcp26": "RCP2.6 (Low Emissions)",
    "rcp60": "RCP6.0 (Intermediate)",
    "rcp85": "RCP8.5 (High Emissions)",
    ...
}
```
The per-scenario file loading loop only tried scenarios in this dictionary, so rcp45 files were never discovered.

**Impact**: 25% of processed data was invisible in visualizations.

**Fix applied**: Changed `generate_maps.py` to dynamically discover scenarios from filesystem using glob pattern `{variable}_*_processed.nc` instead of iterating hardcoded lists.
