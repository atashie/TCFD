# Guardrails - Critical Rules

Rules in this file represent mistakes that were made and must never be repeated. These are non-negotiable requirements that override convenience or efficiency considerations.

See [WORKFLOW-ISSUES.md](WORKFLOW-ISSUES.md) for detailed incident documentation.

## 1. Temporal Resolution Must Be User-Selected

**Rule**: When ISIMIP data is available at multiple temporal resolutions (daily, monthly, annual), **ALWAYS ask the user which resolution they want before downloading**.

**Why this matters**:
- Monthly data is 12x larger than annual data
- Daily data is 365x larger than annual data
- A 10 MB annual file becomes 120 MB monthly or 3.6 GB daily
- Downloading the wrong resolution wastes significant time and storage

**Required workflow**:
1. Search ISIMIP and identify ALL available temporal resolutions
2. Present a summary table showing:
   - Resolution options (daily, monthly, annual)
   - Approximate file sizes for each
   - Number of datasets available at each resolution
3. Use `AskUserQuestion` to have the user explicitly choose
4. Only proceed with download after user selection

**Handling higher-frequency data (monthly/daily)**:
- See Rule §2 below for aggregation requirements
- Current processing scripts are designed for annual data aggregated to decadal metrics
- If monthly/daily data is selected, must ask user how to aggregate before processing

## 2. Sub-Annual Data Aggregation Requires User Choice

**Rule**: When processing monthly or daily data, **ALWAYS ask the user** how to aggregate before processing. Never auto-aggregate without explicit user approval.

**Why this matters**:
- Different variables require different aggregation methods based on their physical meaning
- **Density metrics** (g/m², kg/m², individuals/km²) → typically **mean**
- **Count/flux metrics** (events, kg/year, mm/day) → typically **sum**
- **Extreme metrics** (max temperature, min precipitation) → typically **max** or **min**
- **Categorical metrics** (dominant type, mode) → typically **mode**
- Wrong aggregation produces physically meaningless results

**Required workflow**:
1. Identify that data is sub-annual (monthly or daily)
2. **Tell user the variable units** (critical context for choosing aggregation)
3. Present aggregation options: mean, median, sum, min, max, mode
4. Use `AskUserQuestion` to get explicit user choice
5. Only proceed with processing after user selection
6. Document the aggregation method used in output metadata attributes

**Example aggregation guidance**:
| Variable | Units | Recommended Aggregation |
|----------|-------|------------------------|
| Biomass density | g C m⁻² | mean |
| Precipitation | mm/month | sum (for annual total) |
| Temperature | °C | mean (for annual avg), max/min (for extremes) |
| Fire events | count | sum |
| Species richness | count | mean or max |

## 3. Scenario Discovery Must Be Dynamic

**Rule**: Visualization and processing scripts must **discover scenarios from the filesystem**, not hardcoded lists. Never assume a fixed set of scenarios exists.

**Why this matters**:
- ISIMIP data includes varying scenarios: SSP (126, 245, 370, 585) and RCP (26, 45, 60, 85)
- Not all scenarios are always available for every variable/model combination
- Hardcoded lists silently exclude data that exists but isn't in the list
- Users may have custom scenario subsets

**Required behavior**:
- Scripts should glob for `{variable}_*_processed.nc` pattern
- Extract scenario names from filenames dynamically
- Load ALL matching files, not just predefined scenarios
- Use fallback labels/colors for unknown scenarios (e.g., "ssp245" → "SSP2-4.5")

## 4. Multi-Model Search for Vegetation Variables

**Rule**: When searching for vegetation variables (cwood, npp, gpp, cveg, cleaf, lai, burntarea), **ALWAYS enumerate all available biomes models across simulation rounds** before presenting options to the user.

**Why this matters**:
- Different models use different PFT (Plant Functional Type) classification schemes
- Generic PFT schemes (e.g., CLASSIC's `evgndltr`) combine all needleleaf into one category
- Climate-zone specific PFTs (e.g., CLM45's `needleleaf-evergreen-tree-temperate`) exist in older rounds
- Best climate-specific data may be in ISIMIP2b or ISIMIP3a, not ISIMIP3b
- Users need to make informed trade-offs between data recency and climate specificity

**Required workflow**:
1. Identify target vegetation type and climate zone (temperate, boreal, tropical, etc.)
2. Check `config/isimip_search_catalog.yaml` biomes_models section for all available models
3. List models from ALL relevant simulation rounds (3b, 3a, 2b)
4. Check each model's PFT scheme against user needs
5. Present options with explicit trade-off summary:
   - Newer scenarios (ISIMIP3b SSP) vs climate specificity (ISIMIP2b/3a)
   - Generic PFTs (larger ensemble) vs climate-zone PFTs (better proxy)
   - Global coverage vs regional detail

**Do NOT**:
- Assume the first model found is representative of all available data
- Skip older simulation rounds without explaining trade-offs to user
- Present generic PFT (e.g., `evgndltr`) when climate-specific variants exist
- Default to ISIMIP3b without checking if ISIMIP2b/3a has better PFT coverage

**Example failure**: Searching for "loblolly pine timber proxy" and returning only CLASSIC `evgndltr`, which combines temperate AND boreal conifers into one PFT, when CLM45 has `needleleaf-evergreen-tree-temperate` (temperate-specific) and MC2-USFS has `mesictemperateneedleleafforest` (biome-specific).

**Reference**: See `/isimip-search-download` skill Step 0 (Model Enumeration) and catalog `pft_equivalences` table.

## 5. Diverging Colorscales Must Center on Zero

**Rule**: When visualizing trend or change data, diverging colorscales (RdBu, RdYlBu, etc.) **MUST use symmetric scaling centered on zero** so that white/neutral represents no change.

**Why this matters**:
- Diverging colorscales communicate directionality: one color = positive, other color = negative
- If zero is not at the midpoint (white), the visual interpretation is misleading
- A trend of +0.1 might appear red (bad) if the scale runs from -0.05 to +0.5 with white at +0.225

**Required behavior**:
- For trend and change maps: `max_abs = np.percentile(np.abs(all_values), 98); cmin, cmax = -max_abs, max_abs`
- Do NOT use percentile-based scaling like `cmin = np.percentile(all_values, 2), cmax = np.percentile(all_values, 98)`
- Convention for vegetation/productivity variables ("higher is better"):
  - Positive values (increase) = blue = good
  - Zero = white = no change
  - Negative values (decrease) = red = bad
  - Use `RdBu` colorscale (red-white-blue)

**Implementation**: `scripts/generate_maps.py` uses symmetric scaling for both trend maps (lines 602-610) and change maps (lines 761-765).
